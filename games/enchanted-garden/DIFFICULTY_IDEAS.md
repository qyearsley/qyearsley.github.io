# Future Difficulty & Enhancement Ideas

## Adaptive Difficulty
- **Performance-based adjustment**: Track success rate and automatically adjust difficulty
  - If getting 3+ wrong in a row: reduce difficulty (smaller numbers, simpler problems)
  - If getting all correct quickly: increase difficulty

- **Time-based difficulty**: Factor in how long it takes to answer
  - Fast correct answers → gradually increase difficulty
  - Slow answers (even if correct) → maintain or reduce difficulty slightly

- **Per-area difficulty tracking**: Each area could have its own difficulty level
  - Some kids might be great at addition but struggle with time-telling
  - Independent difficulty progression per area

## Number Range Expansions
- **Easy**: 1-10 (current for most areas)
- **Medium**: 1-20
- **Hard**: 1-50 or 1-100
- **Expert**: Larger numbers, decimals, fractions

## Visual Hint System Enhancements
- **Progressive hint reveal**:
  - First attempt: No hints
  - Second attempt: Partial hints
  - Third attempt: Full visual hints

- **Earn hints with stars**:
  - Spend stars to reveal hints on difficult questions

- **Hint difficulty tiers**:
  - Level 1: Full emoji visualization
  - Level 2: Partial visualization (some hidden)
  - Level 3: Abstract representation only
  - Level 4: No visuals

## Question Type Variations
- **Word problems**: "Sara has 3 apples, gets 5 more..."
- **Missing number**: `__ + 7 = 12` or `5 + __ = 13`
- **Multiple operations**: `(2 + 3) - 1 = ?`
- **Comparison questions**: "Which is larger: 15 or 23?"
- **Estimation**: "About how many..."

## New Areas (Future Expansion)
- **Division Den**: Basic division problems
- **Fraction Forest**: Introduction to fractions (halves, quarters)
- **Money Market**: Counting coins, simple addition with money
- **Shape Space**: Geometry - identify shapes, count sides/corners
- **Word Workshop**: Spelling/reading integration with math

## Accessibility Features
- **Color adjustments**:
  - High contrast mode
  - Colorblind-friendly palettes
  - Dark mode option

- **Audio support**:
  - Read questions aloud
  - Sound effects for correct/incorrect
  - Background music toggle

- **Font options**:
  - Replace Comic Sans with dyslexia-friendly fonts (OpenDyslexic, Lexie Readable)
  - Font size adjustment
  - Spacing adjustments

## Progress & Motivation
- **Daily challenges**: Special problem of the day with bonus rewards
- **Streak tracking**: Count consecutive days played
- **Achievement badges**:
  - "Speed Demon" - 10 correct in under 30 seconds each
  - "Perfectionist" - Complete level with no wrong answers
  - "Persistent" - Complete level after making mistakes but trying again

- **Parent dashboard**:
  - View progress reports
  - See areas of strength/weakness
  - Set daily goals

## Technical Improvements
- **Offline mode**: Service worker for offline play
- **Cloud save**: Sync progress across devices
- **Print worksheets**: Generate printable practice sheets based on current level
- **Export progress**: Download CSV of all activity data

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Animations**: More celebratory animations for milestones
- **Transitions**: Smoother screen transitions
- **Customization**: Let kids choose their avatar/companion creature
- **Themes**: Seasonal themes (winter, spring, etc.)
- **Language support**: Add other languages

## Notes
- Keep it simple and focused on math learning
- Don't overwhelm with too many options
- Maintain fast performance
- Prioritize features that directly help learning
