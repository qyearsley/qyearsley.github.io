## For Developers

### Key Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Main controller accepts optional dependencies for testing
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Configuration Objects**: `PROJECT_CONFIG` centralizes project definitions
- **Event Delegation**: Centralized event handling for performance
- **Double-Submit Prevention**: Flag system prevents accidental duplicate answers

### Running Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### Testing & Development

**Unlock areas for quick testing:**

- `index.html?unlock=all` - Unlock all areas
- `index.html?unlock=crystal-cave` - Unlock specific area

**Starting fresh:**
When you have saved progress, the title screen shows:

- **Continue** - Resume your saved progress
- **Start Fresh** - Reset all progress (with confirmation)

**Console messages:**

- `🔓 All areas unlocked for testing`
- `🔓 Unlocked [area-name] for testing`
- `🔄 Started fresh`

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Fully accessible with keyboard and screen readers.

### Mobile & Tablet Support

- **Dynamic Viewport**: Uses `dvh` units for proper sizing on mobile browsers
- **Touch Optimized**: Prevents unwanted tap highlights and focus persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to screen sizes from phones to tablets to desktop
- **Overscroll Prevention**: Disabled pull-to-refresh for smoother gameplay
