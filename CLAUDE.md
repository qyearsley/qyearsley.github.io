# CLAUDE.md

Context for AI assistants working on this codebase.

## Site Purpose

Personal website showcasing projects and experiments.

## Content

- **Recent projects**: Educational games
- **Legacy content**: JavaScript experiments and Chinese language tools
  - Most pages are self-contained HTML files with inline/minimal JavaScript

## Development Preferences

- **Documentation**: Keep it brief and useful. READMEs should add value, not document for documentation's sake.
- **Testing**: Write clear, robust tests with good coverage for non-trivial code.
- **Code quality**: Follow best practices, use linters, keep things simple.
- **Architecture**: Prefer self-contained files over complex build systems.
- **Security**: Be careful about possible vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, etc.).
