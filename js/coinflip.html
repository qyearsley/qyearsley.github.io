<h1>Coin Flips</h1>

<time datetime="2013-03-21">Created 2013-03-21.</time>

<p>Today in biology class, when the professor was talking about genetic
drift, I learned an interesting fact about probability. If you flip
a coin a small number of times, the percentage of times that the coin
turns up heads tends not to be near 50%. For example, if you flip a coin
ten times, there's a significant chance that the frequency of head will
be 3/10, or 6/10, or 8/10. However, if you flip a coin 10000 times, the
frequency of heads is almost certainly going to be very close to 50%.</p>

<p>This program flips coins. It starts by flipping one coin and recording
the percentage of heads. Then two, then three, and so on, all the way
up to the maximum value that you input below. Then it graphs them. You
can see that as the number of coins flipped increases, the frequency
converges to 50%.</p>
